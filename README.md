This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) for my personal website, [ashsullivan.com](https://ashsullivan.com/). All of the below is technically true if you want
to run the code locally for whatever reason. 

## Preamble

I have 8 years of professional experience, but that professional experience is in proprietary codebases. Since, understandably, sharing
proprietary code samples is not possible, this is a personal website I'm working on to do some fun side projects to practice concepts and
keep myself polished.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
